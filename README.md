Necessary txt files:
Visits, patient population, nurse visits, nurse population, location, detailed list of constacts (DAT file)

Simulations / models:
Carolinesurveillance.ipynb: contains code for high risk node intervention/strategy. Images of Top 10 High risk nodes, distribution of node risk, infection time heatmap.

SimulationwithMobilityData2.ipynb: code file contain the simulation and respective figures of the networks, SIR dynamics over time, midpoint infection, peak infection, peak patient infection.

SimulationwithMobilityData.ipynb: adds onto above file with centrality measures / centrality weighted networks.

SimultationwithIntervention.ipynb: simulation with lockdown wing intervention, figure on "effect of locking down busiest room."

Simulation-maskingandtotaloutbreak.ipynb: simulation with the masking intervention, also the total outbreak graphs (code contains some graphs not used in final paper).

Project-checkpoint.ipynb: part of original code we made that was built on to make our final simulation, nothing useful in here besides seeing our progress path.

Projet - initial sim with small data: built on porject-checkpoint.ipynb to plot epidemic curve, looking at different transmission rates, and outbreak network. Again, this was just initial coding to get a hang of what tools we used for the final simulation.
